    BIG is a research group in the <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/">Robotics Institute</a> 
    at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. 
    Our goal is to create robots that can co-exist and collaborate with humans in shared environments, 
    continuously learning to improve themselves over time through training, exploration, and interaction. Our philosophical research goal is to develop technologies to remind us of “what makes us human,” promoting human values such as safety, creativity, and compassion. Toward this goal, we develop learning and planning algorithms, data utilization methods, simulation technologies, and agentic models.
